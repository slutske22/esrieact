# FeatureLayer

## Introduction

One of the most used layer types is the `FeatureLayer`. A `FeatureLayer` can be declared alone, or can accept a `FeatureLayerView` as a child to help taylor the layer:

```ts
import React from "react";
import { FeatureLayer, FeautureLayerView, MapView } from "esrieact";

const LAYER_URL = "https://services.arcgis.com/V6ZHFr6zdgNZuVG0/arcgis/rest/services/Landscape_Trees/FeatureServer/0";

export const ReactMap: React.FC = () => {
  const [maxStorage, setMaxStorage] = useState(1000);

  return (
    <MapView>
      {/* A simple featurelayer: */}
      <FeatureLayer url="some service url" />

      {/* A featurelayer that uses a FeatureLayerView to do some front-end filtering: */}
      <FeatureLayer url={LAYER_URL}>
        <FeatureLayerView filter={{ where: `C_Storage < ${maxStorage}` }} />
      </FeatureLayer>
    </MapView>
  );
};
```

## Props

`Props` extends [`FeatureLayer properties`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html#properties-summary)

### `children`

Children components can be any of the following esrieact components:

- [`FeatureLayerView`](/layer-views#featurelayerview)
- Any [`Renderer`](/category/renderers) component that is compatible with a FeatureLayer
- [`Graphic`](TODO) or multiple `Graphic`s components

### `events`

`FeatureLayerEventHandlerFnMap`: An event handler function map based on the events available on a FeatureLayer

```ts
  "refresh": __esri.FeatureLayerRefreshEventHandler;
  "edits": __esri.FeatureLayerEditsEventHandler;
  "layerview-create": __esri.FeatureLayerLayerviewCreateEventHandler;
  "layerview-create-error": __esri.FeatureLayerLayerviewCreateErrorEventHandler;
  "layerview-destroy": __esri.FeatureLayerLayerviewDestroyEventHandler;
```
