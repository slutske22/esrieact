# KMLLayer

## Introduction

The `KMLLayer` is used to display KML (Keyhole Markup Language) data on a map. KML is an XML-based format for displaying geographic data in applications like Google Earth. The KMLLayer can be declared alone or with child components to customize its behavior:

```ts
import React from "react";
import { KMLLayer, MapView } from "esrieact";

const KML_URL = "https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/layers-kml/live/kml/Sample.kml";

export const ReactMap: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <MapView>
      <KMLLayer url={KML_URL} />
    </MapView>
  );
};
```
