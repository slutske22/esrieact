# ImageryTileLayer

## Introduction

The `ImageryTileLayer` is used to display tiled imagery data from ArcGIS Image Services on a map. It provides high-performance rendering of imagery data through tiled services and can be declared alone or with child components to customize its behavior:

```ts
import React from "react";
import { ImageryTileLayer, MapView } from "esrieact";

const IMAGERY_TILE_URL = "https://elevation.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/WorldElevation/Terrain/ImageServer";

export const ReactMap: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <MapView>
      <ImageryTileLayer url={IMAGERY_TILE_URL} />
    </MapView>
  );
};
```
