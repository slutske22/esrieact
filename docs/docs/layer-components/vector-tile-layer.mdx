# VectorTileLayer

## Introduction

The `VectorTileLayer` is used to display vector tile data on a map. Vector tiles contain vector data that can be styled and customized on the client side, providing high-performance rendering and flexible styling options. The VectorTileLayer can be declared alone or with child components to customize its behavior:

```ts
import React from "react";
import { VectorTileLayer, MapView } from "esrieact";

const VECTOR_TILE_URL = "https://basemaps.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World_Basemap_v2/VectorTileServer";

export const ReactMap: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <MapView>
      <VectorTileLayer url={VECTOR_TILE_URL} />
    </MapView>
  );
};
```

## Props

`Props` extends [`VectorTileLayer properties`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-VectorTileLayer.html#properties-summary)

### `children`

Children components can be any of the following esrieact components:

- [`LayerView`](/layer-views) component
- Any [`Renderer`](/category/renderers) component that is compatible with a VectorTileLayer

### `events`

```ts
  refresh: __esri.VectorTileLayerRefreshEventHandler;
  "layerview-create": __esri.VectorTileLayerLayerviewCreateEventHandler;
